# wordle-cli

Command-line clone of klipspringr's [nerdle-cli](https://github.com/klipspringr/wordle-cli/) adapted for [Nerdle](https://nerdlegame.com/).

## TODO
[ ] Customize solution, of customizable length.

## Download and run

Requires **Python 3.6** or later, and a **modern terminal app**.

To download the code and run it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/klipspringr/wordle-cli.git && cd wordle-cli
python3 play.py
```

Alternatively, if you don't have git: click `Code > Download ZIP` on GitHub, extract the ZIP, open a terminal, `cd` to the extracted folder and run `python3 play.py`.

A **terminal with support for colours and emoji** is required. On Windows and WSL, [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal) is the best choice. PowerShell and the Windows command prompt are only supported if running in Windows Terminal.
